Following the debut in 2007 of the first iPhone, he founded a storytelling app called Zuuka that built up a library of narrated and illustrated kids\u2019 books for the iPhone and iPad.<\/p>\n<p>Sears later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publishersweekly.com\/pw\/by-topic\/childrens\/childrens-industry-news\/article\/61408-cupcake-digital-acquires-zuuka-and-its-istorytime-library-app.html\">sold<\/a> that company to a small New York-based outfit. But Sears, who is based in Santa Barbara, California, isn\u2019t done with stories yet. Instead, he just raised $1.6 million in seed funding for his second and newest storytelling startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/hearhere.com\/\">HearHere<\/a>, a subscription-based audio road-trip app that, with users&#8217; permission, pushes information to them as they\u2019re driving, giving them informational tidbits in three- to five-minute segments about their surroundings, including points of interest they might not have been aware of at all.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to surface the unknown or forgotten history of regions, which makes sense in a world where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aftermarketnews.com\/overheard-long-distance-road-trips-increase-yoy\/\">more people<\/a> have returned to road trips and parents have grown desperate to pull their kids&#8217; attention away from TikTok. In fact, Sears\u2019s neighbor, Kevin Costner, liked the idea so much that he recently joined its five-person team as a co-founder and narrator and investor, along with Snap Inc., the law firm Cooley, Camping World CEO and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/the-profit\/\">reality TV star<\/a> Marcus Lemonis, AAA and numerous other individual investors, including from NextGen Venture Partners.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Because we, too, like history and road trips (and okay, fine, Kevin Costner), we talked with Sears and Costner earlier today to learn why they think they&#8217;ll succeed with HearHere when other content-rich geo-location based apps have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/24\/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour\/\">fallen short<\/a> of meaningful adoption.<\/p>\n<p>Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re creating an audio map of the U.S., so how many stories do you have banked as we speak?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: We&#8217;re up to 5,500 stories across 22 states, and we&#8217;ll be nationwide by summer. The mission is to connect people to the places that they&#8217;re traveling through, lending people stories about the history, the natural wonders and the colorful characters who&#8217;ve lived in that area. We also do stories about sports and music and provide local insights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: That&#8217;s a lot of content to gather up, edit down, then record. What does the process look like?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: At the end of the day, the content is king, and we take great care with these stories, producing them with a team of 22 researchers, writers, editors and narrators, most whom come from a travel journalism background. We really feel like we get the best end result through that team approach.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, we&#8217;ll open up to third-party content contributors, where we&#8217;re hosting both professional content and also user-generated content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Is there an AI component or will there be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: We more see this as augmented reality in that these stories really do overlay the landscape and give you a different perspective while traveling. But AI and machine learning are things that we&#8217;ll incorporate as we start to move into foreign languages and better tailor the content for the end user.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How do you prioritize which stories to tell as you&#8217;re building up this content library?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: The major historical markers are a big inspiration, but we&#8217;re looking for those lesser-known gems, too, and we look at travel patterns &#8212; the way that people move when they&#8217;re on leisure trips, meaning what interstate highways they&#8217;re taking and which scenic routes are most popular.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How does the subscription piece work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: You get five free free stories each month; for unlimited streaming, it&#8217;s $35.99 per year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Kevin, you must be approached a lot with startup ideas and investment opportunities. Why get so involved with this one?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KC: Obviously I&#8217;m story-oriented; that doesn&#8217;t come as a shock to anybody. But you&#8217;re right, a lot of ideas come to me.<\/p>\n<p>HearHere came through my wife, who said that Woody had something he wanted to talk about, and as she explained it to me, I got it, you know? That&#8217;s the shiny thing for me, storytelling and having the ability for a good story to come out, especially when it comes to our country.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TlmHSDC9AW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/\">Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/embed\/#?secret=TlmHSDC9AW\" data-secret=\"TlmHSDC9AW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>So we had this meeting and he explained the concept to me, which is kind of equal to what I&#8217;d already been doing my whole life, which is stopping at the bronze plaques all over the country and reading about their historical significance &#8212; those [moments] that kind of interrupt everybody&#8217;s trip except mine. [Laughs.] You know, [it&#8217;s] getting out and stretching my legs and reading a little history and dreaming while the rest of the people in the car are kind of moaning because we stopped our progress.<\/p>\n<p>This [product] is an extension of that for me, without getting out of the car, and with stories that can evolve and perhaps get longer. And I can become more involved in what I was driving past and the people in the car can maybe sense what it was that interested me enough to stop.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2133694\" style=\"width: 1500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2133694\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2133694 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1490\" height=\"988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png 1490w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=768,509 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=680,451 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2133694\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hearhere<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You love history.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KC: HearHere is a lot more than history, but for me, it was the history [that I found so compelling]. And it&#8217;s how the foundation was set for me to become more involved in the company and understand it a lot better and then become somebody who wanted to be a part of the founding of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: AAA and Camping World are among the company&#8217;s strategic investors. How might they promote the app and what other partnerships have you struck to get HearHere in front of people at the right time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: Camping World also owns Good Sam Club, which is the largest organization of RV owners in the world, and AAA is a giant with 57 million members in the U.S., and they all see this as a way to fulfill something they&#8217;re aren&#8217;t currently doing for their audience; it&#8217;s making that bridge to digital, and we&#8217;re really excited to get this in front of their members and customers.<\/p>\n<p>We also have partnerships with [the RV marketplaces] Outdoorsy and RVshare [and the RV rental and sales company] Cruise America. It&#8217;s a very hot market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: There have been similar ideas. Caterina Fake&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/findery.com\/\">Findery<\/a> was an early app that aimed to help users discover much more about locations. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/24\/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour\/\">Detour<\/a>, a startup that provided walking audio tours of cities that was founded by Groupon co-founder Andrew Mason, seemed interesting but failed to take off with users. What makes you think this startup will click?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: I loved Detour. I ate up both of those.<\/p>\n<p>I guess where I think [Detour] missed product-market fit was the number of scenarios where you could use it and also, it was competing for people&#8217;s time. We chose to start with road trips because you have a captive audience; there&#8217;s only so much you can do when you&#8217;re driving in the car, unlike when you&#8217;re in a city, where there are all kinds of options to explore its history, including physical books and tour guides. You also had to carve out two hours of your time, and it&#8217;s easy to get distracted while you&#8217;re walking around.<\/p>\n<p>We want to capture the places that are along the journey and lesser known and more untold and where people have the space to engage in it. Starting as short form helps. It&#8217;s also on-demand, so you don&#8217;t have to follow a pre-designated route. We&#8217;re not taking you on a specific tour, where you have to turn left or turn right. We&#8217;re going to surface stories for you no matter what route you take.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woody Sears has long been interested in storytelling.

The same database shows just 35 exits for all of 2020. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/edtech-exits-are-growing-but-by-how-much\/\">As we discussed nearly six months ago<\/a>, the ability to buy (and be bought) has changed.<\/p>\n<p>In the past week, the consolidation environment is making a clear statement: Pandemic-proven startups are scooping up talent \u2014 and fast. Kahoot, which is set to list on the Oslo Stock Exchange within months, has bought three businesses within the past 12 months. Quizlet, which became a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/13\/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic\/\">unicorn nearly one year ago<\/a>, made its first acquisition ever last week.<\/p>\n<p>To understand more about this activity, I caught up with Quizlet CEO Matthew Glotzbach and Kahoot CEO Eilert Giertsen Hanoa. We talked about trends in the space including lifelong learning, self-directed learning and more.<\/p>\n<h2>Q&amp;A is a lucrative business<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cTo be successful students in the past decade or two, it has required self-direction,\u201d Glotzbach said simply a few minutes into our chat. \u201cQuizlet as a platform is helping to empower that self-directed learner and give them the tools they need to really be successful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To further this goal, Quizlet acquired problem-solving tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slader.com\/about\/\">Slader<\/a> last week. Unfortunately, the price of the deal was not disclosed (but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have numbers in the next section). What we do know is that it&#8217;s the startup\u2019s latest move to solidify its focus as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions\/\">tech-powered tutoring tool<\/a> rather than a simple flashcard app.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Quizlet uses its data around flashcard sets, questions and trained natural language processing tools to understand how students might respond to certain prompts. Artificial intelligence gives the company a little more flexibility to understand the different ways a student could correctly answer the same question.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edtech unicorns have boatloads of cash to spend following the capital boost to the sector in 2020.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Venture capital has a diversity problem: <a href=\"https:\/\/about.crunchbase.com\/2020-diversity-spotlight-report\/\">Data<\/a> show that Black and Latinx founders received just 2.6% of overall funding in 2020. Women-founded teams <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders\/\">received nearly 30% less<\/a> funding in 2020 than they did in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, a close-knit community of brilliant but like-minded individuals built a system of pattern recognition. It produced high-growth companies with homogenous leadership teams. They called it meritocracy. Those of us who didn\u2019t fit the profile were told, or were left to assume, that we didn\u2019t have what it takes.<\/p>\n<p>When a founder needs funding but investors don\u2019t think they \u201chave what it takes,\u201d it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. No matter how good you are and how much product-market fit you achieve, at some point \u201cwhat it takes\u201d to scale a company is money.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Until recently, the lack of diversity in the ecosystem was largely an issue to those of us directly affected by it. It wasn\u2019t until the groundbreaking #metoo and #BlackLivesMatter movements that the lack of funding for women and minorities became both evident &#8212; and evidently problematic &#8212; to the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that underrepresented founders are the most undervalued asset class in the U.S. today, and investors are starting to realize that diversity is not charity &#8212; it\u2019s economic opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Just look at the data on women-founded startups, which deliver 63% higher ROI (according to First Round Capital), generate twice as much revenue for every dollar invested (according to BCG), and take one full year less time to exit (according to PitchBook &amp; AllRaise). Founders that have it harder, but persevere, lead to stronger companies with outsized results for their investors.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that recent events jolted many into action. A flurry of pledges, micro-funds and quick investments in support of Black founders arrived in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder last summer. Overnight, these founders were heavily courted for meetings and speaking opportunities from people and firms they didn\u2019t have access to in the past. Some secured investments and built new relationships that will help down the line. For many, the timing was off, and they didn\u2019t benefit materially. In the end, the frenzy quieted down, and only 3% of 2020 VC deal volume went to Black-founded companies.<\/p>\n<p>Ashlee Wisdom, the co-founder and CEO of digital health platform <a href=\"https:\/\/healthinherhue.com\/\">Health in Her HUE<\/a>, experienced this firsthand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast summer I was overwhelmed with inbounds from investors, which felt great at first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was new to venture; I didn\u2019t know how to build a strategy around fundraising, and most of those investors were looking for companies at a later stage than mine. No one I spoke to during that time seemed to be willing to invest in my pre-seed round despite our demonstrated traction. On the positive side, I met a lot of great investors who made meaningful introductions to pre-seed and early-stage funds. And some of those later-stage investors are now watching Health In Her HUE\u2019s progress.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s too soon to tell how sustainable the progress made last year will be. But we do have evidence from prior times that small, cosmetic efforts at diversity do not result in lasting change. Just take a look at what\u2019s happened to VC funding for women recently.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath of #metoo, investors and corporations were also spurred to act, with some success. For a while, VC investments in women-founded companies increased slowly but steadily. But once COVID hit, and investors retreated to their closest and most trusted referral networks, VC funding for women took a huge step backward. Crunchbase data show more than 800 female-founded startups globally received a total of $4.9 billion in venture funding in 2020, through mid-December, representing a 27% decrease over the same period the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>The lesson is this: Efforts at the periphery of venture capital do not make a difference in the long run. The good news is many have started taking action. To achieve systemic, long-term improvements, VC firms will need to make changes to their core system, building diversity into the primary investing process itself. Results will not be visible immediately, but they will be far more sustainable and, as the data suggest, more profitable over the lifetime of these funds. Here are three specific actions VC firms can take to achieve this:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Hire BIPOC and women investors<\/h2>\n<p>A recent<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/reports\/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem\"> PitchBook<\/a> report notes that female investors are twice as likely to invest in companies with female founders and three times as likely in companies with female CEOs. And yet fewer than 10% of all VC partners are women. According to BLCK VC, more than 80% of venture firms don\u2019t have a single Black investor on their team. That makes it less surprising that only 1 percent of venture-funded startup founders are Black.<\/p>\n<p>When you hire from the same communities you want to invest in, and ensure your new hires are set up for success, you unlock dealflow, relationships, and insights into new markets and customer sets. This results in a more diverse portfolio and a stronger investment team, one that serves its entire portfolio of companies better.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Measure the top of your funnel<\/h2>\n<p>Inputs lead to outputs. VC firms should do everything they can to foster stronger relationships with underrepresented founder communities to enable more diversity at the top of the deal flow funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Partner, sponsor and invest in organizations like <a href=\"www.femalefounders.org\">Female Founders Alliance, SoGal Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackwomentalktech.com\/\">Black Women Talk Tech<\/a> and more. Go out of your way to attend events, ask for introductions, schedule casual coffee meetings and meet as many founders in those networks as you can &#8212; and foster those relationships meaningfully over time. This is how you seed decades of great dealflow.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Invest directly in emerging fund managers<\/h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of new funds, many of them with less than $50 million in assets under management, with direct access to pockets of talent that you are not currently seeing. These general partners have trusting, authentic relationships with founders who might be wary of mainstream VC. If you are a larger VC fund, you should be actively investing in them. Emerging managers can act as your scouts, and, in return, you will help build the ecosystem itself.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that the lack of diversity in venture capital is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for those willing to make the earliest bets. If we invest in women at the same rate that we invest in men, this could boost the global economy by up to $5 trillion. That is a huge amount of return up for grabs. A homogenous portfolio misses that opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Most investors I know are aware of the opportunity and genuinely want to do better. The more urgency they feel, the more likely they are to spin up independent initiatives to address inequities directly. While these can be helpful, they\u2019re also not sustainable. The best way to build a sustainably diverse portfolio is to do the slow, hard work of change from the inside out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Underrepresented founders are the

Following the debut in 2007 of the first iPhone, he founded a storytelling app called Zuuka that built up a library of narrated and illustrated kids\u2019 books for the iPhone and iPad.<\/p>\n<p>Sears later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publishersweekly.com\/pw\/by-topic\/childrens\/childrens-industry-news\/article\/61408-cupcake-digital-acquires-zuuka-and-its-istorytime-library-app.html\">sold<\/a> that company to a small New York-based outfit. But Sears, who is based in Santa Barbara, California, isn\u2019t done with stories yet. Instead, he just raised $1.6 million in seed funding for his second and newest storytelling startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/hearhere.com\/\">HearHere<\/a>, a subscription-based audio road-trip app that, with users&#8217; permission, pushes information to them as they\u2019re driving, giving them informational tidbits in three- to five-minute segments about their surroundings, including points of interest they might not have been aware of at all.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to surface the unknown or forgotten history of regions, which makes sense in a world where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aftermarketnews.com\/overheard-long-distance-road-trips-increase-yoy\/\">more people<\/a> have returned to road trips and parents have grown desperate to pull their kids&#8217; attention away from TikTok. In fact, Sears\u2019s neighbor, Kevin Costner, liked the idea so much that he recently joined its five-person team as a co-founder and narrator and investor, along with Snap Inc., the law firm Cooley, Camping World CEO and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/the-profit\/\">reality TV star<\/a> Marcus Lemonis, AAA and numerous other individual investors, including from NextGen Venture Partners.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Because we, too, like history and road trips (and okay, fine, Kevin Costner), we talked with Sears and Costner earlier today to learn why they think they&#8217;ll succeed with HearHere when other content-rich geo-location based apps have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/24\/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour\/\">fallen short<\/a> of meaningful adoption.<\/p>\n<p>Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re creating an audio map of the U.S., so how many stories do you have banked as we speak?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: We&#8217;re up to 5,500 stories across 22 states, and we&#8217;ll be nationwide by summer. The mission is to connect people to the places that they&#8217;re traveling through, lending people stories about the history, the natural wonders and the colorful characters who&#8217;ve lived in that area. We also do stories about sports and music and provide local insights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: That&#8217;s a lot of content to gather up, edit down, then record. What does the process look like?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: At the end of the day, the content is king, and we take great care with these stories, producing them with a team of 22 researchers, writers, editors and narrators, most whom come from a travel journalism background. We really feel like we get the best end result through that team approach.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, we&#8217;ll open up to third-party content contributors, where we&#8217;re hosting both professional content and also user-generated content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Is there an AI component or will there be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: We more see this as augmented reality in that these stories really do overlay the landscape and give you a different perspective while traveling. But AI and machine learning are things that we&#8217;ll incorporate as we start to move into foreign languages and better tailor the content for the end user.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How do you prioritize which stories to tell as you&#8217;re building up this content library?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: The major historical markers are a big inspiration, but we&#8217;re looking for those lesser-known gems, too, and we look at travel patterns &#8212; the way that people move when they&#8217;re on leisure trips, meaning what interstate highways they&#8217;re taking and which scenic routes are most popular.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How does the subscription piece work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: You get five free free stories each month; for unlimited streaming, it&#8217;s $35.99 per year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Kevin, you must be approached a lot with startup ideas and investment opportunities. Why get so involved with this one?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KC: Obviously I&#8217;m story-oriented; that doesn&#8217;t come as a shock to anybody. But you&#8217;re right, a lot of ideas come to me.<\/p>\n<p>HearHere came through my wife, who said that Woody had something he wanted to talk about, and as she explained it to me, I got it, you know? That&#8217;s the shiny thing for me, storytelling and having the ability for a good story to come out, especially when it comes to our country.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TlmHSDC9AW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/\">Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Extra Crunch members get unlimited access to 12M stock images for $99 per year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/25\/extra-crunch-members-get-unlimited-access-to-12m-stock-images-for-99-per-year\/embed\/#?secret=TlmHSDC9AW\" data-secret=\"TlmHSDC9AW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>So we had this meeting and he explained the concept to me, which is kind of equal to what I&#8217;d already been doing my whole life, which is stopping at the bronze plaques all over the country and reading about their historical significance &#8212; those [moments] that kind of interrupt everybody&#8217;s trip except mine.

And I can become more involved in what I was driving past and the people in the car can maybe sense what it was that interested me enough to stop.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2133694\" style=\"width: 1500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2133694\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2133694 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1490\" height=\"988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png 1490w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=768,509 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=680,451 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-2.06.01-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2133694\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hearhere<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You love history.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KC: HearHere is a lot more than history, but for me, it was the history [that I found so compelling]. And it&#8217;s how the foundation was set for me to become more involved in the company and understand it a lot better and then become somebody who wanted to be a part of the founding of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: AAA and Camping World are among the company&#8217;s strategic investors. How might they promote the app and what other partnerships have you struck to get HearHere in front of people at the right time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: Camping World also owns Good Sam Club, which is the largest organization of RV owners in the world, and AAA is a giant with 57 million members in the U.S., and they all see this as a way to fulfill something they&#8217;re aren&#8217;t currently doing for their audience; it&#8217;s making that bridge to digital, and we&#8217;re really excited to get this in front of their members and customers.<\/p>\n<p>We also have partnerships with [the RV marketplaces] Outdoorsy and RVshare [and the RV rental and sales company] Cruise America. It&#8217;s a very hot market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: There have been similar ideas. Caterina Fake&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/findery.com\/\">Findery<\/a> was an early app that aimed to help users discover much more about locations. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/24\/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour\/\">Detour<\/a>, a startup that provided walking audio tours of cities that was founded by Groupon co-founder Andrew Mason, seemed interesting but failed to take off with users. What makes you think this startup will click?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WS: I loved Detour. I ate up both of those.<\/p>\n<p>I guess where I think [Detour] missed product-market fit was the number of scenarios where you could use it and also, it was competing for people&#8217;s time. We chose to start with road trips because you have a captive audience; there&#8217;s only so much you can do when you&#8217;re driving in the car, unlike when you&#8217;re in a city, where there are all kinds of options to explore its history, including physical books and tour guides. You also had to carve out two hours of your time, and it&#8217;s easy to get distracted while you&#8217;re walking around.<\/p>\n<p>We want to capture the places that are along the journey and lesser known and more untold and where people have the space to engage in it. Starting as short form helps. It&#8217;s also on-demand, so you don&#8217;t have to follow a pre-designated route. We&#8217;re not taking you on a specific tour, where you have to turn left or turn right. We&#8217;re going to surface stories for you no matter what route you take.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Woody Sears has long been interested in storytelling.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Venture capital has a diversity problem: <a href=\"https:\/\/about.crunchbase.com\/2020-diversity-spotlight-report\/\">Data<\/a> show that Black and Latinx founders received just 2.6% of overall funding in 2020. Women-founded teams <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders\/\">received nearly 30% less<\/a> funding in 2020 than they did in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, a close-knit community of brilliant but like-minded individuals built a system of pattern recognition. It produced high-growth companies with homogenous leadership teams. They called it meritocracy. Those of us who didn\u2019t fit the profile were told, or were left to assume, that we didn\u2019t have what it takes.<\/p>\n<p>When a founder needs funding but investors don\u2019t think they \u201chave what it takes,\u201d it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. No matter how good you are and how much product-market fit you achieve, at some point \u201cwhat it takes\u201d to scale a company is money.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Until recently, the lack of diversity in the ecosystem was largely an issue to those of us directly affected by it. It wasn\u2019t until the groundbreaking #metoo and #BlackLivesMatter movements that the lack of funding for women and minorities became both evident &#8212; and evidently problematic &#8212; to the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that underrepresented founders are the most undervalued asset class in the U.S. today, and investors are starting to realize that diversity is not charity &#8212; it\u2019s economic opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Just look at the data on women-founded startups, which deliver 63% higher ROI (according to First Round Capital), generate twice as much revenue for every dollar invested (according to BCG), and take one full year less time to exit (according to PitchBook &amp; AllRaise). Founders that have it harder, but persevere, lead to stronger companies with outsized results for their investors.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that recent events jolted many into action. A flurry of pledges, micro-funds and quick investments in support of Black founders arrived in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder last summer. Overnight, these founders were heavily courted for meetings and speaking opportunities from people and firms they didn\u2019t have access to in the past. Some secured investments and built new relationships that will help down the line. For many, the timing was off, and they didn\u2019t benefit materially. In the end, the frenzy quieted down, and only 3% of 2020 VC deal volume went to Black-founded companies.<\/p>\n<p>Ashlee Wisdom, the co-founder and CEO of digital health platform <a href=\"https:\/\/healthinherhue.com\/\">Health in Her HUE<\/a>, experienced this firsthand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast summer I was overwhelmed with inbounds from investors, which felt great at first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was new to venture; I didn\u2019t know how to build a strategy around fundraising, and most of those investors were looking for companies at a later stage than mine. No one I spoke to during that time seemed to be willing to invest in my pre-seed round despite our demonstrated traction. On the positive side, I met a lot of great investors who made meaningful introductions to pre-seed and early-stage funds. And some of those later-stage investors are now watching Health In Her HUE\u2019s progress.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s too soon to tell how sustainable the progress made last year will be. But we do have evidence from prior times that small, cosmetic efforts at diversity do not result in lasting change. Just take a look at what\u2019s happened to VC funding for women recently.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath of #metoo, investors and corporations were also spurred to act, with some success. For a while, VC investments in women-founded companies increased slowly but steadily. But once COVID hit, and investors retreated to their closest and most trusted referral networks, VC funding for women took a huge step backward. Crunchbase data show more than 800 female-founded startups globally received a total of $4.9 billion in venture funding in 2020, through mid-December, representing a 27% decrease over the same period the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>The lesson is this: Efforts at the periphery of venture capital do not make a difference in the long run. The good news is many have started taking action. To achieve systemic, long-term improvements, VC firms will need to make changes to their core system, building diversity into the primary investing process itself. Results will not be visible immediately, but they will be far more sustainable and, as the data suggest, more profitable over the lifetime of these funds. Here are three specific actions VC firms can take to achieve this:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Hire BIPOC and women investors<\/h2>\n<p>A recent<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/reports\/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem\"> PitchBook<\/a> report notes that female investors are twice as likely to invest in companies with female founders and three times as likely in companies with female CEOs. And yet fewer than 10% of all VC partners are women. According to BLCK VC, more than 80% of venture firms don\u2019t have a single Black investor on their team. That makes it less surprising that only 1 percent of venture-funded startup founders are Black.<\/p>\n<p>When you hire from the same communities you want to invest in, and ensure your new hires are set up for success, you unlock dealflow, relationships, and insights into new markets and customer sets. This results in a more diverse portfolio and a stronger investment team, one that serves its entire portfolio of companies better.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Measure the top of your funnel<\/h2>\n<p>Inputs lead to outputs. VC firms should do everything they can to foster stronger relationships with underrepresented founder communities to enable more diversity at the top of the deal flow funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Partner, sponsor and invest in organizations like <a href=\"www.femalefounders.org\">Female Founders Alliance, SoGal Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackwomentalktech.com\/\">Black Women Talk Tech<\/a> and more. Go out of your way to attend events, ask for introductions, schedule casual coffee meetings and meet as many founders in those networks as you can &#8212; and foster those relationships meaningfully over time. This is how you seed decades of great dealflow.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Invest directly in emerging fund managers<\/h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of new funds, many of them with less than $50 million in assets under management, with direct access to pockets of talent that you are not currently seeing. These general partners have trusting, authentic relationships with founders who might be wary of mainstream VC. If you are a larger VC fund, you should be actively investing in them. Emerging managers can act as your scouts, and, in return, you will help build the ecosystem itself.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that the lack of diversity in venture capital is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for those willing to make the earliest bets. If we invest in women at the same rate that we invest in men, this could boost the global economy by up to $5 trillion. That is a huge amount of return up for grabs. A homogenous portfolio misses that opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Most investors I know are aware of the opportunity and genuinely want to do better. The more urgency they feel, the more likely they are to spin up independent initiatives to address inequities directly. While these can be helpful, they\u2019re also not sustainable. The best way to build a sustainably diverse portfolio is to do the slow, hard work of change from the inside out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Underrepresented founders are the

entered a new era in which attacks are becoming more frequent and happening on a larger scale than ever before. Massive hacks affecting thousands of high-level American companies and agencies have dominated the news recently. Chief among these are the December SolarWinds\/FireEye breach and the more recent <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware\/\">Microsoft Exchange server breach<\/a>. Everyone wants to know: If you\u2019ve been hit with the Exchange breach, what should you do?<\/p>\n<p>To answer this question, and compare security philosophies, we outlined what we&#8217;d do &#8212; side by side. One of us is a career attacker (David Wolpoff), and the other a CISO with experience securing companies in the healthcare and security spaces (Aaron Fosdick).<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tDon\u2019t wait for your incident response team to take the brunt of a cyberattack on your organization.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>CISO Aaron Fosdick<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Back up your system. <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A hacker\u2019s likely going to throw some ransomware attacks at you after breaking into your mail server. So rely on your backups, configurations, etc. Back up everything you can. But back up to an instance before the breach. Design your backups with the assumption that an attacker will try to delete them. Don\u2019t use your normal admin credentials to encrypt your backups, and make sure your admin accounts can\u2019t delete or modify backups once they\u2019ve been created. Your backup target should not be part of your domain.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Assume compromise and stop connectivity if necessary.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Identify if and where you have been compromised. Inspect your systems forensically to see if any systems are using your surface as a launch point and attempting to move laterally from there. If your Exchange server is indeed compromised, you want it off your network as soon as possible. Disable external connectivity to the internet to ensure they cannot exfiltrate any data or communicate with other systems in the network, which is how attackers move laterally.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing\/\">filed<\/span> its S-1 last week<\/a>, it was a watershed moment for the robotic process automation (RPA) market. The company, which first appeared on our radar for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/27\/uipath-raises-30m-to-build-software-robots-for-internal-business-tasks\/\">a $30 million Series A<\/a> in 2017, has so far raised an astonishing $2 billion while still private. In February, it was valued at $35 billion <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/01\/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation\/\">when it raised $750 million<\/a> in its latest round.<\/p>\n<p>RPA and process automation came to the fore during the pandemic as companies took steps to digitally transform. When employees couldn&#8217;t be in the same office together, it became crucial to cobble together more automated workflows that required fewer people in the loop.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tRPA has enabled executives to provide a level of workflow automation that essentially buys them time to update systems to more modern approaches while reducing the large number of mundane manual tasks that are part of every industry&#8217;s workflow.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>When UIPath raised money in 2017, RPA was not well known in enterprise software circles even though it had already been around for several years. The category was gaining in popularity by that point because it addressed automation in a legacy context. That meant companies with deep legacy technology \u2014 practically everyone not born in the cloud \u2014 could automate across older platforms without ripping and replacing, an expensive and risky undertaking that most CEOs would rather not take.<\/p>\n<p>RPA has enabled executives to provide a level of workflow automation, a taste of the modern. It essentially buys them time to update systems to more modern approaches while reducing the large number of mundane manual tasks that are part of just about every industry&#8217;s workflow.<\/p>\n<p>While some people point to RPA as job-elimination software, it also provides a way to liberate people from some of the most mind-numbing and mundane chores in the organization. The argument goes that this frees up employees for higher level tasks.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, RPA could take advantage of older workflow technologies like OCR (optical character recognition) to read a number from a form, enter the data in a spreadsheet, generate an invoice, send it for printing and mailing, and generate a Slack message to the accounting department that the task has been completed.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to take a deep dive into RPA and the larger process automation space \u2014 explore the market size and dynamics, look at the key players and the biggest investors, and finally, try to chart out where this market might go in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>Meet the vendors<\/h2>\n<p>UIPath is clearly an RPA star with a significant market share lead of 27.1%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US45411620\">according to IDC<\/a>. Automation Anywhere is in second place with 19.4%, and Blue Prism is third with 10.3%, based on data from IDC&#8217;s July 2020 report, the last time the firm reported on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Two other players with significant market share worth mentioning are WorkFusion with 6.8%, and NTT with 5%.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether pure-play RPA will survive as a category remains to be seen, but it will likely be around for a long time under the intelligent process automation umbrella.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":521068,"featured_media":2132282,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"0ff59c28-c146-36a8-9c5c-eedc8ae36a91"},"categories":[449557044,17396],"tags":[576616251,576626577,576846311,576845141,576860890,15328,449560943,449560942],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/GettyImages-1169397208-1.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/39EtG0f","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.27,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[983141],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2132257"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2132257"}],"version-history":[{"count":25,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2132257\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2133389,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2132257\/revisions\/2133389"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ronjourn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2132257&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/521068"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2132282"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2132257"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2132257"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2132257"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2132257"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2132257"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2132257"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2132257"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":983141,"name":"Ron Miller","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ronjourn\/","description":"","slug":"ronjourn","links":{"homepage":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ron-miller\/","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ron_miller","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ronsmiller","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/ron-miller"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Ron Miller has been writing about the enterprise at TechCrunch since 2014.<\/p>\n\n<p>Previously, he was a long-time Contributing Editor at EContent Magazine.

The SMB-focused public cloud company likely felt like a somewhat obvious IPO candidate when you <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/15\/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation\/\">read its results<\/a>. The Exchange spoke with the company&#8217;s CEO, Yancey Spruill, about the choice.<\/p>\n<p>Latch, in contrast, decided that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/25\/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial\/\">a SPAC was its best route <\/a>out the gate. The Exchange caught up with the company&#8217;s CFO, Garth Mitchell, about the transaction and why it made sense for his company.<\/p>\n<p>And, finally, The Exchange spoke with AlertMedia&#8217;s founder and CEO, Brian Cruver, about his decision to sell his Texas-based company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210310005118\/en\/AlertMedia-Receives-Strategic-Growth-Investment-From-Vista-Equity-Partners\">to a private equity firm<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To prevent this post from reaching an astronomic word count, we&#8217;ll give a brief overview of each deal and then summarize the company&#8217;s views about why their liquidity choice was the right one.<\/p>\n<h2>Three paths to liquidity<\/h2>\n<p>Kicking off with DigitalOcean, a few notes: First, the company has been pretty darn public about its growth in the last few years. We <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability\/\">knew<\/a> that it had an annualized run rate of around $200 million in 2018, $250 million in 2019 and around $300 million in the first half of 2020. It later announced that it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z\/\">hit that mark<\/a> in May of last year.<\/p>\n<p>So when DigitalOcean decided to go public, we weren&#8217;t bowled over. The company wound up pricing at $47 per share, the high end of its range. Since then, its stock has struggled somewhat, falling below $37 per share before recovering to $43.80 at the end of trading yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>Enough of all that. Why did the company choose to go public via a traditional IPO? Spruill said his company looked at SPAC deals and direct listings. It selected the IPO route because it fit the company&#8217;s goals of generating a broad base of shareholders while creating a branding opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of an IPO is comparable, he added, to other exit options. Spruill also praised the IPO process itself, noting that its rigorous requirements made DigitalOcean a better company.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier in our chat, I asked Spruill a question that I put to every CEO on IPO day: <em>How are you feeling?<\/em> It&#8217;s a bit of a sop, but it sometimes elicits insights from executives and founders who, after weeks of discussing their companies&#8217; inner workings, are asked a rare personal question.<\/p>\n<p>Spruill said he felt incredible and that nothing could replicate an IPO as the culmination of so much work put into building a company and its team. If you add up the wins and losses over time, with more of the former than the latter, and can cross the finish line with the right metrics and market, you can earn a spot to be &#8220;grilled&#8221; by the &#8220;best investors,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Those investors put $750 million or so into his company, Spruill added. Funds that it can use to retire debt and free up more cash flow. Not a bad day, I&#8217;d say.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Choosing which option is best from a buffet&#8217;s worth of possibilities is an interesting task for startup CEOs and their boards.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":428363,"featured_media":1996010,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"2e04eb21-641b-3347-9fb1-7ecdfa897d7d"},"categories":[60523764,20429],"tags":[576845141,576847237,428686147,576600686,576765839],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3cJyjrS","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.61,"featured":true,"subtitle":"Three ways to exit in 2021","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2133472"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2133472"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2133472\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2133548,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2133472\/revisions\/2133548"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2133472&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/428363"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1996010"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2133472"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2133472"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2133472"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2133472"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2133472"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2133472"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2133472"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2021\/04\/apple-arcade-expands-its-award-winning-catalog-to-more-than-180-games\/\">has announced<\/a> an expansion for its subscription gaming service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-arcade\/\">Apple Arcade<\/a>. In addition to exclusive game releases, the company is adding two new categories \u2014 Timeless Classics and App Store Greats.<\/p>\n<p>In the &#8220;App Store Greats&#8221; category, you can find some well-known iPhone games that have been released over the past decade, such as Threes+, Mini Metro+, Monument Valley+, Fruit Ninja Classic+, Cut the Rope Remastered and Badland+.<\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting move, as Apple has focused on exclusive titles so far. Arguably, some Apple Arcade games are sequels of popular App Store games \u2014 I\u2019d put Mini Motorways and Rayman Mini in this category, for instance.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But Apple is changing its stance and essentially buying a back catalog of App Store games. Some of them are still available on the App Store, while others have become incompatible with modern iOS versions due to framework and hardware updates. 64-bit processors have rendered many games incompatible for instance.<\/p>\n<p>As always, Apple isn\u2019t just putting free games behind a paywall. These are brand new downloads on the App Store. You get the full game without any ad or in-app purchase.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to old school App Store games, Apple is also adding &#8220;Timeless Classics&#8221; games. It\u2019s a selection of board games and classic puzzle games that are included in your subscription. Games include Backgammon+, Chess Play &amp; Learn+, Good Sudoku+, Tiny Crossword+, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Those games should definitely help when it comes to reducing churn. Some people just like playing chess over and over again. They might start subscribing to play some chess and pay an Apple Arcade subscription just to keep using the same app.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uOPR3ZEXBj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/four-perspectives-on-apples-new-service-bundle\/\">Four perspectives on Apple&#8217;s new service bundle<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Four perspectives on Apple&#8217;s new service bundle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/four-perspectives-on-apples-new-service-bundle\/embed\/#?secret=uOPR3ZEXBj\" data-secret=\"uOPR3ZEXBj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Overall, Apple is dropping 32 games today, and Apple Arcade has more than 180 games in its catalog.

after taking a coding academy bootcamp through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appacademy.io\/\">AppAcademy<\/a> (where Barile met his co-founder, Adam Foosaner), at Google and at a failed cryptocurrency startup.<\/p>\n<p>Burned by the crypto experience, Barile was casting about for his next thing, and trying to find a way to scrape up some rent money, when he hit on the idea for Backflip. The experience of selling electronics online was still shady and Barile and Foosaner thought there had to be a better way.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>That way became Backflip. It offers customers cash on delivery for their used electronics &#8212; anything from Androids to Xboxes and Apple devices to Game Boys.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first started working on backflip back in March 2019, I met this kid named Chris and he wanted to buy some of my old iPhones. He had been a student at USF and as a side hustle he started buying used devices and would refurbish them and then either sell them himself or sell them to an official reseller,&#8221; said Barile. &#8220;Chris started making so much money he dropped out of school. That was a &#8216;holy shit&#8217; moment. He can make a lot of money doing this and he\u2019s doing a really good thing.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The problem, said Barile, was safety. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;He&#8217;s got all these devices he\u2019s acquiring paying cash for and he\u2019s driving all around town\u2026 Everyone who works in the [refurbish and resell] industry has at least one story about getting robbed at gunpoint.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Backflip solved that problem by being the intermediary between buyers and sellers and taking a small commission for managing the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>The company raised its first money at the end of 2019, but before that, Foosaner and Barile lived off of credit and used electronics.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Backflip has facilitated the exchange of roughly 3,000 devices. The company handles everything from wiping a device and ensuring its quality to finding a buyer for the electronics. The company pays out roughly $150 per device and has deposited a little over $500,000 with users of the service, according to data provided by the company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did all sorts of stuff to get our first few users,&#8221; said Barile. We posted ads on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. We started experimenting at the end of the summer with the most bare-bones mobile app kind of thing. At that point it was just Adam and I,&#8221; Barile said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YWTYWt8Btr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder\/\">The 5 biggest mistakes I made as a first-time startup founder<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The 5 biggest mistakes I made as a first-time startup founder&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder\/embed\/#?secret=YWTYWt8Btr\" data-secret=\"YWTYWt8Btr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Starting now, Backflip is working with UPS stores to provide in-person drop-off and packaging centers for the used electronics.

class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tKevin Xu is an early-stage investor and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/interconnected.blog\/author\/kevin\/\">Interconnected<\/a>, a bilingual newsletter covering tech, business and U.S.-Asia relations.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Mexico has been<\/span> known as an up-and-coming tech hub and a gateway to the Latin American market. As an investor focused on developer-centered products, open-source startups and infrastructure technology companies with a particular interest in emerging market innovation, I have been wanting to do some firsthand learning there.<\/p>\n<p>So, despite the ongoing pandemic, I took all the necessary precautions and spent roughly seven weeks in Mexico from January to March. I spent most of my time meeting founders to get a handle on what they are building, why they are pursuing those ideas, and how the entire ecosystem is evolving to support their ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tKnowledge transfer is not the only trend flowing in the U.S.-Asia-LatAm nexus. Competition is afoot as well.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>The U.S.-Asia-LatAm nexus<\/h2>\n<p>One fascinating, though not surprising, observation was how much LatAm entrepreneurs look to Asian tech giants for product inspiration and growth strategies. Companies like Tencent, DiDi and Grab are household names among founders. This makes sense because the market conditions in Mexico and other parts of LatAm resemble China, India and Southeast Asia more than the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>What often happens is entrepreneurs first look to successful startups in the U.S. to emulate and localize. As they find product-market fit, they start to look to Asian tech companies for inspiration while morphing them to suit local needs.<\/p>\n<p>One good example is Rappi, an app that started out as a grocery delivery service. Its future ambition is squarely to become the superapp of LatAm: It is expanding aggressively both geographically <em>and <\/em>productwise into delivery for restaurant orders, pharmacy and even COVID tests. It\u2019s also introducing new payment, banking and financial-service products. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pagaconrappi.com\/\">Rappi Pay<\/a> launched in Mexico just a few weeks ago, while I was still in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Rappi now looks more like Meituan and Grab than any of its U.S. counterparts, and that\u2019s not an accident. SoftBank, whose portfolio contains many of these Asian tech giants, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/30\/softbank-makes-a-huge-bet-on-latin-america\/\">invested<\/a> heavily in Rappi\u2019s previous two rounds and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/03\/07\/softbank-launches-5-billion-latin-america-tech-fund.html\">now has a $5 billion fund dedicated<\/a> to the LatAm region. The knowledge and experience accumulated from Asian tech in the last 10 years is transferring to like-minded firms like Rappi, right under Silicon Valley\u2019s proverbial nose.<\/p>\n<h2>U.S.-Asia-LatAm competition<\/h2>\n<p>Knowledge transfer is not the only trend flowing in the U.S.-Asia-LatAm nexus. Competition is afoot as well.<\/p>\n<p>Because of similar market conditions, Asian tech giants are directly expanding into Mexico and other LatAm countries. The one I witnessed up close during my visit was DiDi.<\/p>\n<p>DiDi\u2019s foray into LatAm started in January 2018 with its acquisition of 99, a Brazilian ride-sharing company. In April 2018, DiDi entered Mexico with its bread-and-butter ride-sharing service. It<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/emerging-mobile\/battle-of-latam-food-delivery-apps-81e7588cd6c4\"> wasn\u2019t until April 2019<\/a> that DiDi launched its food delivery service, DiDi Food, in Monterrey and Guadalajara &#8212; two of the largest cities in Mexico. Its expansion hasn\u2019t slowed down since, with a 10% extra earnings incentive to lure delivery drivers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2133348\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2133348\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2133348\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg\" alt=\"DiDi delivery worker recruitment promotion banner outside venue\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/didi_promotion_small.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2133348\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Kevin Xu<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>My Airbnb in Mexico City happened to be two blocks away from the large WeWork building where DiDi\u2019s local office was located.

The same database shows just 35 exits for all of 2020. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/14\/edtech-exits-are-growing-but-by-how-much\/\">As we discussed nearly six months ago<\/a>, the ability to buy (and be bought) has changed.<\/p>\n<p>In the past week, the consolidation environment is making a clear statement: Pandemic-proven startups are scooping up talent \u2014 and fast. Kahoot, which is set to list on the Oslo Stock Exchange within months, has bought three businesses within the past 12 months. Quizlet, which became a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/13\/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic\/\">unicorn nearly one year ago<\/a>, made its first acquisition ever last week.<\/p>\n<p>To understand more about this activity, I caught up with Quizlet CEO Matthew Glotzbach and Kahoot CEO Eilert Giertsen Hanoa. We talked about trends in the space including lifelong learning, self-directed learning and more.<\/p>\n<h2>Q&amp;A is a lucrative business<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cTo be successful students in the past decade or two, it has required self-direction,\u201d Glotzbach said simply a few minutes into our chat. \u201cQuizlet as a platform is helping to empower that self-directed learner and give them the tools they need to really be successful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To further this goal, Quizlet acquired problem-solving tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slader.com\/about\/\">Slader<\/a> last week. Unfortunately, the price of the deal was not disclosed (but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have numbers in the next section). What we do know is that it&#8217;s the startup\u2019s latest move to solidify its focus as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions\/\">tech-powered tutoring tool<\/a> rather than a simple flashcard app.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Quizlet uses its data around flashcard sets, questions and trained natural language processing tools to understand how students might respond to certain prompts. Artificial intelligence gives the company a little more flexibility to understand the different ways a student could correctly answer the same question.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edtech unicorns have boatloads of cash to spend following the capital boost to the sector in 2020.

class=\"featured__span-first-words\">By now, all<\/span> companies are fundamentally data driven. This is true regardless of whether they operate in the tech space. Therefore, it makes sense to examine the role data management plays in bolstering \u2014 and, for that matter, hampering \u2014 productivity and collaboration within organizations.<\/p>\n<p>While the term \u201cdata management\u201d inevitably conjures up mental images of vast server farms, the basic tenets predate the computer age. From censuses and elections to the dawn of banking, individuals and organizations have long grappled with the acquisition and analysis of data.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tBy understanding the needs of all stakeholders, organizations can start to figure out how to remove blockages.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>One oft-quoted example is Florence Nightingale, a British nurse who, during the Crimean war, recorded and visualized patient records to highlight the dismal conditions in frontline hospitals. Over a century later, Nightingale is regarded not just as a humanitarian, but also as one of the world\u2019s first data scientists.<\/p>\n<p>As technology began to play a greater role, and the size of data sets began to swell, data management ultimately became codified in a number of formal roles, with names like \u201cdatabase analyst\u201d and \u201cchief data officer.\u201d New challenges followed that formalization, particularly from the regulatory side of things, as legislators introduced tough new data protection rules \u2014 most notably the EU\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/gdpr-info.eu\/\">GDPR legislation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This inevitably led many organizations to perceive data management as being akin to data governance, where responsibilities are centered around establishing controls and audit procedures, and things are viewed from a defensive lens.<\/p>\n<p>That defensiveness is admittedly justified, particularly given the potential financial and reputational damages caused by data mismanagement and leakage. Nonetheless, there\u2019s an element of myopia here, and being excessively cautious can prevent organizations from realizing the benefits of data-driven collaboration, particularly when it comes to software and product development.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking the offense<\/h2>\n<p>Data defensiveness manifests itself in bureaucracy. You start creating roles like \u201cdata steward\u201d and \u201cdata custodian\u201d to handle internal requests. A \u201cgovernance council\u201d sits above them, whose members issue diktats and establish operating procedures &#8212; while not actually working in the trenches. Before long, blockages emerge.<\/p>\n<p>Blockages are never good for business. The first sign of trouble comes in the form of \u201cdata breadlines.\u201d Employees seeking crucial data find themselves having to make their case to whoever is responsible. Time gets wasted.<\/p>\n<p>By itself, this is catastrophic. But the cultural impact is much worse. People are natural problem-solvers. That\u2019s doubly true for software engineers. So, they start figuring out how to circumvent established procedures, hoarding data in their own \u201csilos.\u201d Collaboration falters. Inconsistencies creep in as teams inevitably find themselves working from different versions of the same data set.<br \/>\n<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being excessively cautious can prevent organizations from realizing the benefits of data-driven collaboration.

stream of politics, tech and media stories. Today, I am greeted with a picture of something called Feedly Cloud and the following message:<\/p>\n<p><em>Scheduled Maintenance Feedly will be back in less than 30 minutes.<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Sixty minutes later, it still says that. Feedly is built on RSS aggregation of my favorite news sources, things like The New York Times, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Protocol, Deadline and Techmeme, and writers like Om Malik and Benedict Evans. Notice that very few newsletter authors make this list, mostly because they push via email. I wonder if that is because vendors like Substack and Revue want to promote their subscription model, but if so that is shortsighted. It&#8217;s not about the subscription, it&#8217;s about the relationship.<\/p>\n<p>I pay a monthly fee to Feedly, and I get a piece of the Web I can call my own. If I see something I want to find later, I put it in the read later &#8220;folder.&#8221; If I think I might want to refer to it in the newsletter, I push it to a Feedly board that I can import into Revue along the right side of the screen. If I want to push a story live to the Telegram stream, I drop it on a board where a series of bots posts it to a chain of locations ending with the @gillmorgang Twitter identity. If I click the Feedly icon, it&#8217;s now less than 90 minutes &#8217;til Feedly won&#8217;t be back.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Revue has a section in the right screen list called My Items, where I&#8217;ve added a link to a Rolling Stone story with the following title:<\/p>\n<p><em>Hear How Beck Turned Paul McCartney\u2019s \u2018Find My Way\u2019 Into a Funky Dance Number<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Rolling Stone has gone to a partial firewall model with a subscribe button, but kindly leaves access to the Vevo promo video embedded on the Gillmor Gang newsletter link below. Someone on the YouTube page has posted part of the Rolling Stonewalled text Wikipedia-style in the comments section, copied below (Beck speaking:)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I remember hanging out with Paul and his wife Nancy several years ago and Nancy mentioned that she wanted to go out dancing before calling it a night.\u00a0We ended up at some club in West Hollywood and I remember noticing that Paul and Nancy were TEARING IT UP \u2013 really enjoying themselves more than anyone else on the dance floor.\u00a0Last year when he asked me to remix this track, I remembered that night and wanted to try to recapture that amazing spirit I felt while watching him on the dance floor\u2026sort of my little tribute to Paul \u201cin his groove.\u201d\u00a0When I then heard the falsetto vocal in Paul\u2019s original track I wanted to lean further into something really loose and funky \u2013 I pulled out my Hofner (because of course) and put down a few bass lines\u2026and everything came to life from there.\u00a0The best part of the entire experience, though, came a week after I\u2019d turned in the remix, when Paul called to tell me he\u2019d been dancing in his kitchen to the track all week.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The track runs 4:56, so a few clicks later I&#8217;m probably down to 80 minutes to go.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe this is a more serious problem, I begin to suspect. Is there a business model problem here? McCartney is getting paid. Beck is getting paid. Steely Dan is not getting paid for that wonderful chord, the one where the keyboard stretches out to the horizon and meets the rhythm track. I&#8217;m getting paid, too. Click it again, go ahead.<\/p>\n<p>I went back to the original version of this song, a record called McCartney III which the artist has written, played all the instruments and recorded track by track during the pandemic. It&#8217;s fun, reminiscent of the original McCartney I he released to break up the Beatles in 1970. But this reimagining with Beck I like a whole lot better. Paul may have been the cute one, but he always glowed in resonance with John Lennon. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting better all the time&#8230; Can&#8217;t get much worse.&#8221; Beck doesn&#8217;t have the Lennon mordant wit, but he brings a sardonic edge that works in this vaccinated time.<\/p>\n<p>As Joe Biden joked in his press conference the other day about his predecessor, &#8220;Oh God, I miss him.&#8221; Not really. We&#8217;re reimagining how to get back to work from everywhere, and I bet the answer is a lot more like life + than hybrid. On this episode of the Gillmor Gang, Denis Pombriant uses Zoom&#8217;s Stop Video button to great effect to opt out of more Fungible talk, non or otherwise. Now you see him, now you don&#8217;t. But he can hear you. It&#8217;s Zoom&#8217;s new Instant Clubhouse effect. Clap on, clap off. Somehow I doubt we&#8217;re eager to give that up as a collaboration tool going forward. Clap back on.<\/p>\n<p>Just then, Feedly came back to life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/gillmorgang\/issues\/gillmor-gang-newsletter-revue-4-318346\"> Gillmor Gang Newsletter<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">__________________<\/p>\n<p>The Gillmor Gang \u2014 Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.
